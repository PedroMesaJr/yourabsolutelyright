              Ever notice how Claude AI always says "You're absolutely right" before gently correcting you?
              Yeah, we did too. ðŸ¤–

            <p className="about-text">
              So we made merch about it.

            <p className="about-text">
              This started as a joke. Then it became a website. Now it's a real store selling
              real products with the most reassuring phrase in AI history.
            </p>

            <p className="about-text">
              Because sometimes you need a mug that validates you, even when you're wrong.

            <h2 className="about-subtitle">Why Though?</h2>
            <p className="about-text">
              Look, we're not here to change the world. We're here to put "You're absolutely right"
              on things you can buy. That's it. That's the business model.
            </p>

            <p className="about-text highlight-text">
              You're absolutely right to be here. ðŸ’¯

            <h2 className="about-subtitle">The Fine Print</h2>
            <p className="about-text small-text">
              All products are printed on-demand by Printful (because we're not running a warehouse).
              Payments processed securely by Stripe (because we're not storing your credit card info).
              Orders ship worldwide (because geography is just a social construct).

              Questions? Comments? Want to tell us we're wrong about something so Claude can tell you
              "you're absolutely right"? We're listening.
