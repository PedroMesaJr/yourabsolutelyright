# DESIGN INSPIRATION - Old Raggedy Aesthetic

## Reference Sites & Inspiration

### 1. Vintage Minimalist Websites
**Key Elements I Like:**
- Soft, aged paper backgrounds (#F4F3EE, cream/beige tones)
- Clean typography with vintage feel
- Minimal UI chrome - let content breathe
- Subtle textures that suggest age without being distracting
- Generous whitespace (or "cream-space" in our case)
- Simple, honest layouts

### 2. Worn Paper Textures
**Characteristics:**
- Tea-stained, aged paper look
- Subtle grain and imperfections
- NOT too distressed - keep it readable
- Faded edges, gentle wear
- Warm, inviting color palette

### 3. Typography Inspiration
**Style Notes:**
- Clean sans-serif (Inter, similar to Claude's interface)
- NOT typewriter fonts (too literal)
- Good readability, warm personality
- Generous letter-spacing for hero text
- Mix of weights: light for elegance, bold for emphasis

### 4. Layout Philosophy
**What Works:**
- Single-page scroll design
- Hero section takes full viewport
- Horizontal product carousel (mobile-friendly swipe)
- Minimal navigation - don't overcomplicate
- Footer with essential links only

## Color Palette Notes

### From Logo (hero-logo.png)
- **Primary Coral:** #E67E5E - vibrant but warm, not neon
- **Deep Coral:** #D06D4F - for shadows/depth
- **Cream Text:** #FFFEF9 - soft white on coral background
- **Starburst Effect:** Creates energy without being loud

### From Claude Brand
- **Pampas:** #F4F3EE - main background, aged paper
- **Cloudy:** #B1ADA1 - muted beige-gray for subtle elements
- **Crail:** #C15F3C - terracotta accent
- **Dark Brown:** #3C3532 - text color, warm not harsh

## Texture & Effects Notes

### Subtle Texture Application
- Very light paper grain on background
- NOT heavy grunge - keep it clean
- CSS: subtle noise filter or SVG pattern
- Opacity: 2-5% max, barely noticeable

### Shadows & Depth
- Soft, diffused shadows
- Brown tones, not gray/black
- Product cards: gentle lift on hover
- NO harsh drop-shadows

### Borders & Lines
- Rounded corners: 4-8px (subtle)
- Border colors from beige/brown palette
- Thin lines: 1-2px max
- Dividers: minimal, when necessary

## Layout Spacing Philosophy

### Breathing Room
- Hero section: Full viewport height
- Product cards: Generous padding (24-32px)
- Between sections: 80-120px
- Mobile: Reduce but maintain proportions

### Alignment
- Left-aligned text for readability
- Centered hero elements for impact
- Product grid: centered on page

## Interactive Elements

### Hover States
- Product cards: subtle lift (translateY: -4px)
- Buttons: slightly lighter color
- Transitions: 250ms ease (not too fast)
- Cursor: pointer on clickables

### Buttons
- Rounded corners: 8px
- Padding: 12px 24px
- Coral accent (#E67E5E) on hover
- Text: medium weight, readable

## Mobile Considerations

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640-1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

### Mobile Adaptations
- Hero text: scale down (4-6rem instead of 8rem)
- Product carousel: horizontal scroll with touch
- Spacing: reduce by 50% on mobile
- Navigation: hamburger if needed, or just minimal links

## Inspiration Summary

**The Vibe:**
- Warm, nostalgic, slightly worn

**NOT This:**
